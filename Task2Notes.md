Part 1
This language isn't context free because we were able to break the pumping lemma principles for multiple different pumping lengths. Our general strategy was to input a string where n = pumping length. This made it such that uvxywas composed entirely of a's from the first batch. When we pumped up i, the number of a's became inbalanced and the string left the language. 

Part 2 
This language is context free given that it satisfies the conditions of the pumping lemma. Our strategy for selecting a partition was to chose an equal number of c/d's from the middle so any pumping would maintain their equivalency without disturbing the inequality in the number of a's and d's.
